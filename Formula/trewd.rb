# The TrewSync server, trewd, installed from its GitHub release.
#
# This file is the formula for the tap at github.com/waynehoover/homebrew-tap,
# where it lives as Formula/trewd.rb, so that
#
#   brew install waynehoover/tap/trewd
#
# works. The copy here is the source: it is rendered for each server release by
# scripts/homebrew-formula.sh from that release's published SHA256SUMS, and the
# rendered file is what is copied into the tap. Until the first server release
# it names version 0.0.0, which does not exist, and every sha256 below is a
# placeholder; `brew install` refuses it, which is the right answer.
#
# The binaries are the bare executables the release ships, trewd-<os>-<arch>,
# with nothing to unpack. `trewd update` leaves a Homebrew install alone and
# says to run `brew upgrade trewd`, because Homebrew keeps its own record of
# what it installed and would put the old binary back.

      The service below serves the vault in #{var}/trewd on 127.0.0.1:3003,
      without the MCP endpoint. Put TLS in front of it (tailscale serve, Caddy)
      before any device outside this machine connects. The first device's
      invite in #{var}/trewd/first-invite names this machine at port 3003, which
      no device behind TLS can use: make the first one with
      `trewd invite -data #{var}/trewd -url wss://NAME`, the name your devices reach.
